## How it works

Once you know the dates you'll be in Japan, you can create a trip adding both the dates and the destinations you'll be visiting. You can browse the selection of activities we have available and find ideas to add to your trip plan.

In your trip page, you can give it a custom name and drag and drop activities to your calendar as you wish.
